# DAEMod-915
Bradley University senior capstone project by Peter Handler, Connor Dickey, and Philip Pierce for a 915MHz ISM open-source and open-hardware digital transceiver implementing Digital radio modes that uses a configurable duty cycle compared to the proprietary alternative LoRa. The goal is to create an example board for digital radio communication. Our design focuses on extensible and easy communication which is configurable to specific use cases like a remote trail camera system or a modernized pager system. We chose low-cost and ubiquitous hardware to build a sustainable platform. Overall, this repository showcases the potential use cases of a finalized product.
